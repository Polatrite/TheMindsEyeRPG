@plugindesc v1.1 - Allows you to use a skill directly from the command menu
rather than going to the skill menu.
@help 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
== Description ==

This plugin allows you to add commands that allow your actors to use skills
directly without accessing the skill menu.

All of the skill use properties are the same: your actor must be able to
use the skill, have enough MP/TP/other requirements, and so on.

If enemy or actor selection is required, they will be processed as usual.

== Terms of Use ==

- Free for use in non-commercial projects with credits
- Contact me for commercial use

== Change Log ==

1.1 - Dec 21, 2015
  * fixed bug where extra data was not converted to number
1.0 - Dec 6, 2015
  * initial release
 
== Required ==

* Actor Battle Commands
  http://himeworks.com/2015/12/actor-battle-commands/
  
This plugin must be placed under Actor Battle Commands

== Usage ==

To add a "use skill" command to your actors, note-tag actors with

  <battle command: use_skill ID />
  
Where the ID is the ID of the skill that you want to use.
For example, if your Fire skill was ID 26 in the database, you
would write

  <battle command: use_skill 26 />
  
Please refer to the usage section for Actor Battle Commands to see what kind
of command management functionality is available.

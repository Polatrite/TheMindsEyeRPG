MUD School<br>
This is the entrance to the ROM Mud School. Go north to go<br>
through mud school. If you have been here before and want

to go directly to the arena, go south. A sign warns 'You may<br>
not pass these doors once you have passed level 5.'<br>

Huh?

Okay, I'm in the MUD. I can see now. I still can't talk, but at least I can think without using a command interpreter.

What the hell do I do now?

\>\c[14]Yannick tells you '\<Welcome to the Mind's Eye!  Looks like you've been sucked in from IRL.  \|That's a bummer.  \.You'll have to reach Hero to get out of here.

\c[14]You tell Yannick 'What? Why? That doesn't make sense.'

\c[14]Yannick tells you 'The first thing you'll want to do is clear MUD School.  You're already in the entrance, just go north!'

\c[14]You tell Yannick 'But I'm nochanned.'
